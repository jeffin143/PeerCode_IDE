# **Are You Bored of Sharing Code on Chats üì± and getting them back from friends üìü after edit and still the code doesn't works**üòï
......still this cycle goes endless üåå

## *So thats Why i Built this Collaborative Coding IDE WebApp*
### *How is it Different...Well üêí nothing Unique but here is, what this project has to Offer.*

You have a Seperate **Canvas Board** where you can discuss your logic by noting them down to that canvas and other user in **RealTime** will also be able to see them. ( Thanks to the Socket.io Library üåû )

You can share your Code Link and When other user Edits your code you will be able to see the code manipulation Live.
### `Steps to use the App in Local System`
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
### `developement Shots`
### `first visit to homepage and enter details of username and Room ID.`

### `You will redirected to unique URL. Share this URL to Your Peer So that the changes made by peer in Your Code is visible in realtime.`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.#

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
